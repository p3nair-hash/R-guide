    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>Welcome to Stars Hollow.</strong></p>
    <p>This is not your standard, boring statistics textbook. This is a survival guide. I built this because learning R should be as fast-paced as a Friday night dinner and as comforting as a burger from Luke's.</p>
    <p>Whether you are a Chilton student striving for Valedictorian or a Yale student trying to impress the Daily News, this guide covers everything from basic vectors to complex power analysis.</p>

    <h2>House Rules</h2>
    <p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> No cell phones. (Luke's Rules applies).</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Coffee is mandatory while coding.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 3:</strong> If your code errors, do not panic. Channel your inner Paris Geller and force the data to submit to your will.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 4:</strong> Always check your assumptions. (Kirk might be hiding in your data).</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <img src="IMG_9881.PNG" alt="The Author" class="author-photo">
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Parthiv (Pav) Nair</strong> and I'm a pre-med student at UCSD. I created this site to learn and survive <strong>BILD 5</strong>.</p>
    <p>However, after someone close recently professed immense fear in learning R, I built this to help out maybe a little bit </p>
    <p>My goal is to take the "scary" out of statistics and replace it with references to 2000s pop culture. If I can learn to use <code>pivot_longer()</code> without crying, so can you.</p>
